\section{Introduction}

Alignment is the task of ensuring that the behavior of a
Large Language Model (LLM) is consistent 
with human preferences. 

A key difference between the alignment phase and
other phases of training an LLM is that the alignment phase considers
full sequences of text, rather than simply predicting the next token, as
in the pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) phases. 

The alignment approach popularized by the commercial success of ChatGPT was 
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF, \cite{ouyang2022training}). 
Despite its effectiveness, RLHF requires training a second model, called
a reward model, as well as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), resulting in a 
technique that is more complex than the basic supervised learning. It also
requires a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence term to regularize the
changes to the LLM during alignment training.

Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a simpler approach to alignment
which does not require a secondary reward model. In the paper introducing
DPO, the authors examine the underlying
approach of RLHF and propose
the DPO objective to align the target LLM directly using
maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). 
The key insight from the DPO paper is that an LLM's
outputs can be reparameterized into a reward model using ratios, logs,
and the Bradley-Terry model (\cite{bradley1952rank}).

The specific contribution of this paper is to reframe the alignment
phase away from reward modeling entirely and treating it simply as
a pure supervised learning problem by training a model to align to
a directly modified probability distribution. We call this
approach Supervised Learning Preference Optimization (SLPO).

\section{Preliminaries: DPO}

We review and continue the analysis of the DPO objective by its 
authors.

The DPO objective is defined as follows:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dpo}
  L_\mathrm{DPO}(\pi_\theta; \pi_\mathrm{ref}) =
  \underbrace{
  -\mathbb{E}_{(x, y_w, y_l) \sim D} 
  \log }_{1} 
  \left[ 
    \underbrace{\sigma }_{2}
    \left(
    \underbrace{\beta \log \frac{\pi_\theta(y_w \mid x)}{\pi_\mathrm{ref}(y_w \mid x)}}_{3}
    - \underbrace{\beta \log \frac{\pi_\theta(y_l \mid x)}{\pi_\mathrm{ref}(y_l \mid x)}}_{4} 
    \right)
  \right].
\end{equation}

In the underbraced section 1, we see the standard 
negative log likelihood (NLL) objective.
In the underbraced section 2, we see the Bradley-Terry model 
\footnote{A ranking method that is mathematically equivalent and perhaps more 
widely understood is the ELO score, used to rank Chess players, 
and, LLMs in the Chatbot Arena (\cite{elo1978rating,chiang2024chatbot}). 
Both ELO and Bradley-Terry assign scores to players, and 
pass the difference through a sigmoid function to assess the probability of 
the minued (aka LHS) player of winning and subrahend (aka RHS) player of losing.}.
In the underbraced sections 3 and 4, we see how the 
reference and language model's predictions are reparameterized
into a winning and losing score: they are the 
log of the ratio of the language model to the reference model, for the winning and 
losing completion, respectively. 
This score is later described as the reward function.

With simple algebraic manipulation, we can rewrite this objective as:

\[
  \label{eq:reg}
  L_\mathrm{DPO}(\pi_\theta; \pi_\mathrm{ref}) =
  \underbrace{
  -\mathbb{E}_{(x, y_w, y_l) \sim D} 
  \log }_{1} 
  \left[ 
    \underbrace{\sigma }_{2}
    \left(
    \underbrace{\beta \log \frac{\pi_\theta(y_w \mid x)}{\pi_\theta(y_l \mid x)}}_{3}
    - \underbrace{\beta \log \frac{\pi_\mathrm{ref}(y_w \mid x)}{\pi_\mathrm{ref}(y_l \mid x)}}_{4} 
    \right)
  \right].
\]

We can interpret the undercomponents as follows: 
The first and second underbraces remain unchanged. 
The third underbrace is the log of the ratio
language models probability of the winner divided by the loser. This ratio 
is optimized to be bigger, given that the log, sigmoid, and log from underbraces
1, 2, and 3 are all monotonic functions. Since a ratio of probabilities is
an odds ratio, we will refer to this as the 
\emph{language model's log-odds ratio}. 

The fourth underbrace is reference model's log-odds ratio. This
is a constant per $y_w$ and $y_l$ and is not differentiated. However,
these values and their ratio vary across different $y_w$ and $y_l$ - that is,
each row of training data will have a different value for this constant. 
More specifically, since $\pi_\theta$ is initialized as $\pi_\mathrm{ref}$, 
the difference between underbraces 3 and 4 starts at zero during training, 
and the shape of the sigmoid function (underbrace 2) and its gradient are
known. During training, as the language model's log-odds ratio increases,
the sigmoid function will naturally regularize and decelerate
the increase by reducing the magnitude of the gradient (a 
useful version of the vanishing gradient problem). 
This is the exact outcome described by the DPO authors 
in their analysis of the gradient of DPO. \emph{But we have developed a different
intuition the DPO loss: rather than reparameterizing the language model's
output into a reward model, the DPO objective optimizes the 
language model's log-odds ratio, with a constant shift so that the 
shifted value starts at zero during optimization.}

Let's continue reworking the DPO objective into mathematically
equivalent forms to better understand it by looking at tokens and their logits rather
than sequences \footnote{
  Technically, a logit is the log-odds ratio and it is the output of a 
  feature extractor before a sigmoid activation function in binary
  classification. The term logit is also used for categorical classification,
  when a feature extractor's outputs are 
  activated with the softmax function. However,
  these softmax logits cannot be exponentiated to calculate an odds ratio. 
  They do have an unfortunate property
  however: they are shift invariant, leading to numerical instability and
  the need for log-softmax and its use of the log-sum-exp trick to improve
  numerical stability. In this paper, since we are dealing
  with both sigmoid and softmax functions, we will refer to the value
  passed into a softmax function as a softmax logit.
}. 

The variable $y$ is a sequence of tokens, defined as

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:joint}
  \pi_\mathrm{ref}(y \mid x) = \prod_{t=1}^T \pi_\mathrm{ref}(y_t \mid x, y_{<t}),
\end{equation}

where \(y = (y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_T)\) is the output sequence, 
\(x\) is the input context, and \(y_{<t} = (y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_{t-1})\) 
represents the tokens generated prior to time step \(t\). The term 
\(\pi_\mathrm{ref}(y_t \mid x, y_{<t})\) denotes the conditional 
probability of generating token \(y_t\) given the input \(x\) and 
the previously generated tokens \(y_{<t}\).

Since both $\pi$ language model are LLMs, they are activated
using the softmax function. 
The softmax operation can be mathematically cumbersome 
due to its dependence on all other logits for normalization. 
For simplicity, we assume that the logits are transformed 
using a log-softmax function, which computes the logarithm 
of the softmax probabilities in a numerically stable way. 
This transformation results in log-probs, 
which are easier to reason about since they 
can be exponentiated to recover probabilities. 
Importantly, we do not lose any generality because 
log-probs can also be passed through a softmax 
function to recover probabilities, ensuring equivalent behavior.

Let us establish the term $\mathrm{g}$ for the layers of the model up to the softmax
activation, namely, the feature extractor and log-softmax normalization: 

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:g}
  \mathrm{g}(y \mid x) = \mathrm{logsoftmax}(\mathrm{f}(y \mid x))
\end{equation}
such that
$
  \pi(y \mid x) = \exp (\mathrm{g}(y \mid x)).
$
Plugging Equations ~\ref{eq:joint} and ~\ref{eq:g} into the DPO objective ~\ref{eq:dpo}, 
\begin{multline}
  \nonumber
  L_\mathrm{DPO}(\pi_\theta; \pi_\mathrm{ref}) = 
  -\mathbb{E}_{(x, y_w, y_l) \sim D} 
  \log \\ 
  \left[
    \sigma 
    \left(
      \beta \log \frac
      {\prod_{t=1}^{T_w} \exp (\mathrm{g_\theta}(y_{w,t} \mid x, y_w{<t}))}
      {\prod_{t=1}^{T_w} \exp (\mathrm{g_\mathrm{ref}}(y_{w,t} \mid x, y_w{<t}))}
      - 
      \beta \log \frac
      {\prod_{t=1}^{T_l} \exp (\mathrm{g_\theta}(y_{l,t} \mid x, y_w{<t}))}
      {\prod_{t=1}^{T_l} \exp (\mathrm{g_\mathrm{ref}}(y_{l,t} \mid x, y_w{<t}))}
      \right)
      \right]
    \end{multline} 
which simplifies to: 
\begin{multline}
  L_\mathrm{DPO}(\pi_\theta; \pi_\mathrm{ref}) = 
  -\mathbb{E}_{(x, y_w, y_l) \sim D} 
  \log \\ 
  \left[
    \sigma 
    \left(
      \beta 
        \left( 
          \sum_{t=1}^{T_w} \left[ \mathrm{g_\theta}(y_{w,t} \mid x, y_{w,<t}) - \mathrm{g_\mathrm{ref}}(y_{w,t} \mid x, y_{w,<t}) \right] 
          - 
          \sum_{t=1}^{T_l} \left[ \mathrm{g_\theta}(y_{l,t} \mid x, y_{l,<t}) - \mathrm{g_\mathrm{ref}}(y_{l,t} \mid x, y_{l,<t}) \right] 
        \right)
    \right)
  \right]
\end{multline}

We notice another possibility to rewrite the DPO objective towards something
more familiar. Optimizing the sigmoid of a difference $a-b$ through BCE 
is equivalent to optimizing the softmax of $a$ and $b$ through CCE towards 
a one-hot encoded target of $y_\mathrm{true} = [1, 0]$. 
This is well known
but derived in Appendix~\ref{app:ce-of-diff-same-as-softmax}. This allows
us to rewrite the DPO objective as follows:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dpo-as-cce}
L_\mathrm{DPO}(\pi_\theta; \pi_\mathrm{ref}) = 
-\mathbb{E}_{(x, y_w, y_l) \sim D} \, 
\text{CCE}
\left[
y_\mathrm{true} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\ 
0
\end{bmatrix}
\right]
,
y_\mathrm{pred} = \text{softmax}
\left(
\begin{bmatrix}
\beta S_w \\ 
\beta S_l
\end{bmatrix}
\right)
\end{equation}
where
\[S_w = \sum_{t=1}^{T_w} \big(\mathrm{g_\theta}(y_{w,t} \mid x, y_{w,<t}) - \mathrm{g_\mathrm{ref}}(y_{w,t} \mid x, y_{w,<t})\big),
\]
\[
S_l = \sum_{t=1}^{T_l} \big(\mathrm{g_\theta}(y_{l,t} \mid x, y_{l,<t}) - \mathrm{g_\mathrm{ref}}(y_{l,t} \mid x, y_{l,<t})\big).
\]

\paragraph{Key Observation \#1: Much of the DPO objective 
can be simplified to the form of a 
standard classification task.} \label{obs:dpo-as-cce}
This formulation of the DPO objective provides our first key observation. 
What started off as a complex reparameterization 
of the language model's output into a reward
model and a Bradley-Terry model, 
has been simplified into a standard 
categorical crossentropy loss applied to the softmax, in
Equation~\ref{eq:dpo-as-cce}. However, the
input to the softmax is not a single value, 
it's a sum of differences of values. That difference, and that
sum, are the remaining nuances to resolve. 

\paragraph{Key Observation \#2: All the language model's winning and losing
token logits are scaled to zero at the start of training.} 

Since
the language model is initialized by the reference model,
the difference starts at zero for the logits of all the
differences of logits $\mathrm{g_\theta} - \mathrm{g_\mathrm{ref}}$.
This means that at the start of training, all the gradients
on all the winning tokens in the language model will be the same
(and likewise for the losing tokens). This difference is the
vestige of the \emph{log odds ratio of the language model}
in the original DPO formulation. 

\paragraph{Key Observation \#3: The softmax of a sum of inputs 
is equivalent to mean of softmax on each input
with a very low temperature, 
strongly disincentivizing material updates during backpropagation.} 
\label{obs:softmax-cce}
The final remaining nuance is that the softmax is applied to
the sum of the inputs, where the inputs were originally
softmax logits during next
token prediction pretraining. 
What happens when the input to a softmax with two outputs is a sum? First, we make 
a few reasonable assumptions. 
\begin{itemize}
\item The softmax's $y_\mathrm{true} = [1, 0]$. 
\item The softmax's first input $S_w$ and its subcomponents, the shifted logits, starts at zero and increases during optimization, remaining non-negative. 
\item The softmax's second input $S_l$ and its subcomponents, the shifted logits, starts at zero and decreases during optimization, remaining non-positive.
\item The shifted winning logits will move in sync with each other. 
This would certainly be true if the logits were free variables, 
but the logits are entangled since they are the result of 
the complex nonlinear function $\mathrm{g}$. 
\item The shifted losing logits will move in sync with each other.  
This would certainly be true if the logits were free variables, 
but the logits are entangled since they are the result of 
the complex nonlinear function $\mathrm{g}$. 
\end{itemize}

We show in Appendix~\ref{app:softmax-sum-temp} that the softmax where
an input is the sum of subcomponents under the above
assumptions is approximated by optimizing each input directly via CCE(softmax) with
temperature scaling to a very low temperature, introduced in
\cite{hinton2015distilling}. 

\paragraph{Key Observation \#4:
Although optimization of the shifted logits are strongly decelerated, 
the final objective is still $+inf$ and $-inf$ for each shifted logit.} This
is obvious from Equation~\ref{eq:dpo-as-cce}. An equivalent statement is that
the DPO objective does not consider any sequence other than the
winning and losing, and if left unchecked, would ultimately force
the model to predict the winning sequence with probability 1 and all
other sequences, including the loser, with probability 0. This is obviously
destabilizing, e.g. other sequences which may have been perfectly
fungible as alternative winning sequences. 

We have been able to remove much of the machinery of the DPO objective, first
through algebraic manipulation, and then through some assumptions. 
can we take these learning and fix the final issue of the DPO loss? 

\section{Preliminaries: Probabilistic Classification}

A basic task for deep learning has been classification, both
binary and categorical. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Look at this image and decide which  of the ten digits it is(\cite{lecun1998mnist}).
\item Classify every pixel in this image as a foreground class or background. 
\item Decide if this movie review's sentiment is positive or
negative(\cite{Pang+Lee:04a}).
\end{itemize}

Modern LLMs auto-regressively predict a probability distribution for 
the next token among a finite set of possibilities, conditioned on the 
previous tokens. Hence, an LLM also solves 
a classification problem. 

Given the prevalence of classification, deep learning oftens assumes
target labels can be described as either ordinal numbers
or equivalently one-hot encoded vectors. When target labels are
intermediate values between one and zero, they were called "soft targets", 
treated as an regularization technique or even called dark knowledge
(\cite{hinton2015distilling, szegedy2016rethinking,hinton2014dark}). 

But the two roots of the crossentropy
loss functions: KL divergence and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) applied
to the probability distribution function of a Multi-Bournoulli
distribution, are not limited to binary and categorical outcomes. 
For example, the crossentropy loss function can be used directly 
to condition a model to predict to be true 60\% of the time and false 40\% of 
the time, as demonstrated in Figure \ref{fig:ce06}. 
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{ce06.png}
  \label{fig:ce06}
  \caption{Setting $y_\mathrm{true}$ to a value 
  other than 0 or 1 is a valid 
  use of the crossentropy loss 
  function and perfectly consistent with
  both KL divergence and MLE.}
\end{figure}

The term we will use for the idea of
predicting a probability distribution is \emph{probabilistic classification}.

\section{Supervised Learning Preference Optimization}

Armed with intuition of the DPO loss and probabilistic classification, we can
now turn to a simpler, supervised learning approach to alignment. Our
goals are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Apply only MLE under a probabilistic classification approach. 
  That is, we only want to use a CCE loss function. 
\item Avoid any RL concepts like rewards.
\item Avoid any unexplained ratios, logs, or Bradley-Terry models.
\item Instead of having an unconstrained objective and then heavily 
  decelerating it, specify an objective with a natural "bowl shape" to assist
  in optimization.
\item Explicitly stabilize the model's predictions for all other sequences
  other than the winning and losing sequences.
\end{itemize} 

The SLPO objective is defined as follows:

\begin{multline}
  L_\mathrm{SLPO}(\pi_\theta; \pi_\mathrm{ref}) =
  -\mathbb{E}_{(x, y_w, y_l) \sim D} \\
  \left(
  \left(
    \underbrace{
      w_w * \log(\pi_\theta(y_w \mid x))
    }_{1}
  \right)
    + 
  \left(
    \underbrace{
      0 * \log(\pi_\theta(y_l \mid x))
    }_{2}
  \right)
  + 
  \left(
    \underbrace{
      (1 - w_w) * \log(\pi_\theta(y_o \mid x))
    }_{3}
  \right) 
  \right)
\end{multline}

where 
\[
w_w =  \cdot \left( \pi_\mathrm{ref}(y_w \mid x) + \pi_\mathrm{ref}(y_l \mid x) \right).
\]

Intuitively, the goal is to take the probabilities of the winning
and losing sequence and reallocate them to the winning sequence (underbrace 1).
The losing sequence is optimized to zero probability (underbrace 2). 
Importantly,
the other tokens are directly optimized to maintain 
the same probability as the reference model - 
This is essentially the SLPO's version of
the KL divergence regularization term in traditional RLHF (underbrace 3). 

Alternatively, a softer version of the SLPO objective 
would be
\begin{multline}
  L_\mathrm{SLPO}(\pi_\theta; \pi_\mathrm{ref}) =
  -\mathbb{E}_{(x, y_w, y_l) \sim D} \\
  \left(
  \left(
      w_w * \log(\pi_\theta(y_w \mid x))
  \right)
    + 
  \left(
      w_l * \log(\pi_\theta(y_l \mid x))
  \right)
  + 
  \left(
      (1 - w_w - w_l) * \log(\pi_\theta(y_o \mid x))
  \right) 
  \right)
\end{multline}
where
\[
w_w = \alpha \cdot \left( \pi_\mathrm{ref}(y_w \mid x) + \pi_\mathrm{ref}(y_l \mid x) \right),
\]
\[
w_l = (1 - \alpha) \cdot \left( \pi_\mathrm{ref}(y_w \mid x) + \pi_\mathrm{ref}(y_l \mid x) \right),
\]
and 
\[
0.5 < \alpha <= 1.0.
\]

\section{Implementation}

The $y_o$ set of sequences grows intractably as 
$\mathrm{vocab size}^{\mathrm{sequence length}}$.

\subsection{Efficient Implementation of the SLPO Objective}

However, we can optimize the SLPO objective by 
recognizing that the output of a model with a vocabulary size of 
$v$ (i.e., the number of possible tokens) and a 
sequence length of $t$ (i.e., the number of tokens per sequence) 
produces a tensor of shape:

\[
(B, T, V)
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $B$ is the batch size,
    \item $T$ is the sequence length,
    \item $V$ is the vocabulary size.
\end{itemize}

This tensor represents $v \times t$ logits per sample, corresponding to the unnormalized probabilities for each possible token at each timestep.

Of these $v \times t$ logits, we can mask $y_w$ as a vector of length $t$, extracting the log probabilities for the winning tokens while treating the sum over all other logits (i.e., those corresponding to $y_o$ and $y_l$) as the probability of $P(y_o + y_l)$.

For numerical stability, instead of directly summing softmax probabilities, we use the \textbf{logsumexp trick}, which ensures stable computation by preventing underflow and overflow when summing probabilities in the log domain:

\[
\log P(y_o + y_l) = \mathrm{logsumexp_{y_o, y_l}} \pi_\theta(y_o \mid x).
\]

We can implement this loss function efficiently in PyTorch as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

def slpo_loss(logits, y_w, y_l, w_w):
    """Computes the SLPO loss.

    Args:
        logits: Model output logits of shape (B, T, V)
        y_w: Indices of winning tokens (B, T)
        y_l: Indices of losing tokens (B, T)
        w_w: Weight for winning sequence (B, T)
    
    Returns:
        Tensor: SLPO loss
    """
    # Compute log probabilities using log_softmax for numerical stability
    log_probs = F.log_softmax(logits, dim=-1)  # (B, T, V)

    # Extract log probabilities for the winning tokens y_w
    log_prob_w = log_probs.gather(dim=-1, index=y_w.unsqueeze(-1)).squeeze(-1)  # (B, T)

    # Create a mask to exclude y_w and y_l from logsumexp computation
    mask = torch.ones_like(log_probs, dtype=torch.bool)  # Create a mask of ones (B, T, V)
    mask.scatter_(-1, y_w.unsqueeze(-1), False)  # Mask out y_w
    mask.scatter_(-1, y_l.unsqueeze(-1), False)  # Mask out y_l

    # Apply the mask to log_probs, replacing masked entries with a large negative value
    log_probs_masked = log_probs.masked_fill(~mask, float('-inf'))

    # Compute logsumexp over all vocabulary tokens except y_w and y_l (P(y_o))
    log_prob_o = torch.logsumexp(log_probs_masked, dim=-1)  # (B, T)

    # Compute final loss: weighted sum of log probabilities
    loss = -torch.mean(w_w * log_prob_w + (1 - w_w) * log_prob_o)

    return loss
\end{verbatim}

\section{Equivalence of Cross-Entropy on Sigmoid of Difference
and Categorical Cross-Entropy on Softmax for Two Classes}

\label{app:ce-of-diff-same-as-softmax}

Logistic regression uses 
a single logit \(\alpha\), transforming it through the \emph{sigmoid} function to obtain 
a probability \(\sigma(\alpha) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\alpha}} \). The \emph{binary cross-entropy} 
(BCE) loss for a label $y$ and predicted probability \(\hat{y} = \sigma(\alpha)\) is:
\[
  \text{BCE}(y, \hat{y})
  \;=\;
  - \left[
      y \,\log(\hat{y})
      \;+\;
      (1 - y)\,\log (1 - \hat{y})
    \right].
\]

Alternatively, single-label multiclass classification of two 
outcomes uses two softmax logits \(z_1\) and \(z_2\) (one per class) 
and applies the softmax function to obtain probabilities:
\[
  p(y=1 \mid z_1, z_2)
  \;=\;
  \frac{e^{z_1}}{e^{z_1} + e^{z_2}},
  \qquad
  p(y=2 \mid z_1, z_2)
  \;=\;
  \frac{e^{z_2}}{e^{z_1} + e^{z_2}}.
\]
The associated categorical cross-entropy (CCE) loss is: 
\[
  \text{CCE}(y, \hat{y})
  \;=\;
  -\sum_{k=1}^2 y_k \,\log (\hat{y}_k ),
\]
where \(\hat{y}_1 = \frac{e^{z_1}}{e^{z_1} + e^{z_2}}\), 
\(\hat{y}_2 = \frac{e^{z_2}}{e^{z_1} + e^{z_2}}\), 
\(y_1 = 1\), and
\(y_2 = 0\). 

If we set 
\[
  \alpha = z_1 - z_2,
\]
then
\[
  \frac{e^{z_1}}{e^{z_1} + e^{z_2}}
  =
  \frac{1}{1 + e^{z_2 - z_1}}
  =
  \sigma(\alpha).
\] 
Therefore, the predicted probability $\hat{y_1}$ from softmax
matches the \(\sigma(\alpha)\) in logistic regression. This means that 
the BCE loss on the sigmoid of a difference of two numbers ($z_1 - z_2$) 
is equivalent
to the CCE loss on the softmax of the first class
($z_1$) (\cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}).


\section{Approximate Equivalence of Softmax of Sum and Temperature Scaling}

\label{app:softmax-sum-temp}

Here we show that the two-class softmax of a sum of inputs $\alpha_0..\alpha_T$, 
holding 
all other inputs constants, is appromixated by 
temperature scaling, under simplifying assumptions:

\begin{itemize}
  \item We consider the case where the first class is true and the second class is false. 
  \item we assume the output of softmax is passed to Categorical Crossentropy (CCE) loss. 
  \item We assume the second logit to the softmax is zero.
  \item We assume the inputs are approximately equal to each other. 
  \item We assume the many inputs, such as 100. 
\end{itemize}

The softmax of the sum of T inputs is:

\[
  \text{softmax}(
                 [\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \ldots + \alpha_T, 0])
  = 
  \frac{e^{\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \ldots + \alpha_T}}{e^{\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \ldots + \alpha_T} + e^0}
\]

The gradient of the softmax function with a CCE loss is well known to be:
\[
  \frac{\partial \text{CCE}}{\partial z_i} = \hat{y_i} - y_i.
\] 
Equivalently, since $\hat{y_i}$ is the softmax of the sum of the inputs,
\[
  \frac{\partial \text{CCE}}{\partial z_i} = \text{Softmax}(z_i) - y_i,
\] where $z_i$ is the input to softmax. 
Applying this to our unusual softmax of a sum formulation by setting 
$z_i = \sum_{i=1}^T \alpha_i$:
\[
  \frac{\partial \text{CCE}}{\partial z_i} = \text{Softmax}([\sum_{i=1}^T \alpha_i, 0]) - y_i.
\] The nuance here is that due to the chain rule, the gradient on the 
sum of the inputs is passed to each input independently. This is the heart 
of the "multiplication" effect which we will soon see is equivalent to temperature scaling.
For every input $\alpha_k$, the gradient is:
\[
  \frac{\partial \text{CCE}}{\partial \alpha_k} = \text{Softmax}([\sum_{i=1}^T \alpha_i, 0]) - y_i.
\]
But since we assumed all the inputs are approximately equal to each other,
this is equivalent to:
\[
  \frac{\partial \text{CCE}}{\partial \alpha_k} = \text{Softmax}([T \times \alpha_k, 0]) - y_i.
\] for all $k$. Rewriting this with the definition of softmax
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:softmax-sum}
  \frac{\partial \text{CCE}}{\partial \alpha_k} = \frac{e^{T \times \alpha_k}}{e^{T \times \alpha_k} + e^0} - y_i.
\end{equation} shows a multipler on the input $\alpha_k$ of $T$, representing the cardinality 
of the elements of the sum (e.g. tokens in a sequence). 

Now let's turn to the temperature scaling. The canonical definition of temperature scaling 
per \cite[Equation~2]{hinton2015distilling} is the following, where we use the term
$\mathrm{temp}^{-1}$ to distinguish it from our use of $T$ as the number
of inputs:

\[
\frac{\partial \mathcal{C}}{\partial z_i} = \mathrm{temp}^{-1} \left( 
\frac{e^{z_i \cdot \mathrm{temp}^{-1}}}{\sum_j e^{z_j \cdot \mathrm{temp}^{-1}}} 
- 
\frac{e^{v_i \cdot \mathrm{temp}^{-1}}}{\sum_j e^{v_j \cdot \mathrm{temp}^{-1}}} 
\right)
\] 
where $v_i$ are logits of the teacher and
$z_i$ are the logits of the student. Equivalently:
\[
\frac{\partial \mathcal{C}}{\partial z_i} = \left( 
\frac{e^{z_i \cdot \mathrm{temp}^{-1} - \log(\mathrm{temp})}}{\sum_j e^{z_j \cdot \mathrm{temp}^{-1} - \log(\mathrm{temp})}} 
- 
\frac{e^{v_i \cdot \mathrm{temp}^{-1} - \log(\mathrm{temp})}}{\sum_j e^{v_j \cdot \mathrm{temp}^{-1} - \log(\mathrm{temp})}} 
\right).
\]
Considering we only have two classes, and the second class has a fixed
logit of zero, we can simplify this to:
\[
\frac{\partial \mathcal{C}}{\partial z_1} 
= 
\left( 
\frac{e^{z_1 \cdot \mathrm{temp}^{-1} - \log(\mathrm{temp})}}{e^{z_1 \cdot \mathrm{temp}^{-1} - \log(\mathrm{temp})} + e^{-\log(\mathrm{temp})}} 
- 
\frac{e^{v_1 \cdot \mathrm{temp}^{-1} - \log(\mathrm{temp})}}{e^{v_1 \cdot \mathrm{temp}^{-1} - \log(\mathrm{temp})} + e^{-\log(\mathrm{temp})}} 
\right),
\]
As the logits are optimized up to reasonable non-zero values such as 1.0, 
and with
the assumption that the term $\mathrm{temp}^{-1}$ is large (e.g. the 
number of tokens in a sequence such as 100), 
the terms $\log(\mathrm{temp})$ is dominated
by the term $\mathrm{temp}^{-1}$ and the term . We can replace the terms that use $v$
with $y_i$ since we are using hard targets, not soft labels from a teacher. 
Hence, we can approximate the gradient under KD as

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \mathcal{C}}{\partial z_i} = \left( 
  \frac{e^{z_1 \cdot \mathrm{temp}^{-1} }}{e^{z_1 \cdot \mathrm{temp}^{-1} + \mathrm{C}}} 
  - 
y_1
\right)
\end{equation}
where $\mathrm{C}$ is a small constant that is dominated by the term 
$e^{z_1 \cdot \mathrm{temp}^{-1}}$. For example, at reasonable values of 
$z_1 = 1.0$ and $\mathrm{temp}^{-1} = 100$, the term 
$e^{z_1 \cdot \mathrm{temp}^{-1}} = e^{100}$, while the term
$e^{-\log(\mathrm{temp})} = 1 / temp = 0.01$. 

This exactly of the form of Equation~\ref{eq:softmax-sum} with the 
temperature scaling term $\mathrm{temp}^{-1}$ replacing the number of inputs 
(such as the number of tokens in a sequence) $T$.
Hence, optimization proceeds, a softmax of a sum of
many inputs is equivalent to optimizing the softmax of each input with
a low temperature. 

See Figure~\ref{fig:temperature_grad} for an illustration of this concept.

    The red update represent the actual update to a logit. But on the next
    itertion of backprop, the gradient is not calculated based on the sigmoid of 
    logit itself, but the sigmoid of the sum of the logit and nine others,
    all of which are approximately equal. This pushes the gradient
    calculation out to a less steep part of the curve. This "step function"
    like behavior is similar to a low temperature scaling of a logit
    during training.
